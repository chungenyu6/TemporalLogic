## Tools
- MATLAB
- [LTL2BA](http://www.lsv.fr/~gastin/ltl2ba/)

Put the following files in the same folder with `Solution` files to successfully use 
the [Dijkstra´s Algorithm Package](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14661-dijkstra-very-simple) for the code.
- `dijkstra.m` 
- `exchangenode.m`
- `listdijkstra.m`
- `setupgraph.m`

## Solution
Practice creating Buchi Automaton and implementing LTL specification, 
which related to course content : **Temporal Logic and Automata**.

- `Answer_specification.txt` refers to the syntax of the Buchi Automaton, with respect to each specification. 
(Copy from the LTL2BA website)
- `Answer_PA_Whole_Path.txt` created by `Solution.m` 
- `Answer_PA_Accepting_Path.txt` created by `Solution.m`
