### Part 1 

Consider a 2D environment with $0 \le x \le 10$ and $0 \le y \le 8$. Write a Matlab code that
will get an arbitrary integer input $(n,m)$ and create an $n\times m$ grid on the environment. Allow actions
fup; right; down; left; stay on the grid and create a graph representation by creating a Matlab structure T,
where T:states will refer to the set of states based on the grid (i.e., each grid cell will be a state), T:adj will
be the adjacency matrix with a dimension of nm  nm and represent the feasible state transitions over the
graph.
