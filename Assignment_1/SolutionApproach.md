## Dependencies
Put the following files in the same folder with `Solution` files to successfully use 
the [Dijkstra´s Algorithm Package](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14661-dijkstra-very-simple) for the code.
- `dijkstra.m` 
- `exchangenode.m`
- `listdijkstra.m`
- `setupgraph.m`

## Solution Approach
Practice creating directed graph, which related to course content : **Modeling Dynamical Systems**.

If you are not familiar with directed graph in MATLAB, 
refers to the official page : [Directed and Undirected Graphs](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/directed-and-undirected-graphs.html)

Also, I've put most of the explanation at in my comment part of the code.
